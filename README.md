# Slides

Slides is a presentation framework starter written with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Spectacle](https://formidable.com/open-source/spectacle/) with MDX support. It can be used to create dynamic presentations. I've hacked this together in the wee hours prior to presenting at conferences, so beware.
